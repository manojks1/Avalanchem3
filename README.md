# ERC20

This is a contract to mint,transfer and burn the token from a Address.


## Description

This Solidity smart contract facilitates the creation of a custom ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, named 'ZLINE' with the symbol 'ZEE.' Leveraging the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation for enhanced security, the contract grants the owner the ability to mint new tokens and allocate them to a designated address, transfer tokens between addresses, and execute token burning.

## Requirements

To use this contract, you will need:

1)An Ethereum wallet (such as MetaMask or a test address) to interact with the contract

2)Some gas fees on the transaction
## Usage

1)Deploy the contract onto the Ethereum network using Remix or an alternative Solidity compiler. Ensure that you set the name and symbol for your token during deployment.

2)After successful deployment, invoke the mint function to generate new tokens and allocate them to a specific address. Note that only the contract owner possesses the authority to call this function.

3)Employ the transfer function to initiate the transfer of tokens from one address to another.

4)Utilize the burn function to permanently eliminate tokens from circulation. This action irreversibly reduces the total supply of the ERC20 token.
